Telegram bot for communicating with ChatGPT

This is telegram bot, which you can use to talk with ChatGPT right in the telegram chat. This bot uses telebot and openai packages. You can easily launch it by activating venv inside telebot-venv/
For its work you only need to paste a ChatGPT API token to the gpt-api file and telegram bot token into the bot-token file. Each file inside src/ subdirectory
Also it is strongly required not to paste any additional symbols to this files, this would break the bot.
If you like the bot, you can write a comment on my GitHub.
